---- Test and calibration mode:

-- Calibration mode:

  Hold the power button till LED turns blue, then release click:
    - Calibration mode is on for 15 seconds. Youâ€™ll need to add 1kg. weight on the scales in this period (15 seconds ).
    - In case calibration was successful - the LED blinks 2 times in green color and this means that calibration is done.

  If LED blinks 3 times in red color - calibration failed, this could be for many reasons (unconnected platform, bad sensor, etc.)

-- Send a test SMS message:

  Hold the power button till LED turns blue, hold for another 3 seconds ( do not release click when LED turns blue), when LED turns green, release click :
    - This will send a test SMS message.

  If LED blinks 2 times in red - scales does not have master phone number (you need to set it in the scales settings )
